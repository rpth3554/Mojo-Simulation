# Mojo-Simulation :Computer Aided Simulation Results Processor
A mojo Codebase to Process simulation Results.


Welcome to the Mojo-Simulation GitHub repository! This tool efficiently processes vast amounts of computer-aided simulation results, some reaching up to several gibibytes. We have incorporated the capabilities of the [Lasso-python](https://github.com/path_to_lasso_python) repository to provide a fast and efficient experience in simulation data management and analysis.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Processing**: Handle gigabytes of simulation data smoothly and quickly.
  
- **Integration with Lasso-python**: Seamlessly utilize Lasso's feature selection and regularization tools directly with your simulation results.
  
- **Modular Design**: Easy to integrate with other tools or expand upon for more specific needs.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   
2. **Navigate to the repository**:
3. **Install required dependencies**:
4. **Ensure you have Lasso-python**: If not, follow the installation instructions on [Lasso-python's repository](https://github.com/path_to_lasso_python).

## Usage

1. **Basic Usage**:

Replace `your_input_file.sim` with your simulation results and `output_processed_data.sim` with your desired output filename.

```bash
python casr_processor.py --input your_input_file.sim --output output_processed_data.sim
