A mojo Codebase to Process simulation Results.


Welcome to the Mojo-Simulation GitHub repository! This tool efficiently processes vast amounts of computer-aided simulation results, some reaching up to several gibibytes. We have incorporated the capabilities of the [Lasso-python](https://github.com/path_to_lasso_python) repository to provide a fast and efficient experience in simulation data management and analysis.
